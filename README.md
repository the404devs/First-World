# First World
### December 4th, 2013
----------------------
My original Minecraft world.

Created in Minecraft 1.5.1, with seed -1141326854820238648

Versions from **2013-12-04** to **2018-08-14** come from archived copies retrieved from old PCs, thus the history of this period is very patchy and incomplete. The oldest known version is from **2014-09-01**.

Versions from **2018-08-14** to **2022-01-01** come from in-game backups. These are weekly at best, and were usually created when upgrading to a new Minecraft version, typically during snapshot development periods.

Versions from **2022-01-01** onwards are committed directly after a play session.
